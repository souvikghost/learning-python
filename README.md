# Python Learning – using UV

A minimal FastAPI project set up using **uv** for modern, isolated Python development.  
This repository demonstrates a clean project, basic routing, and proper environment management.

## ✅ What’s Implemented

- Python **3.12** pinned per project
- Dependency management using **uv**
- FastAPI application with multiple endpoints
- Clean route separation (`auth`, `user`)
- Reproducible environment via `uv.lock`
- System Python left untouched

---

## API Endpoints

- `POST /signup`
- `POST /login`
- `GET /user`

---

## Purpose

This project is focused on learning:
- FastAPI fundamentals
- Basic API structure
- Proper project setup using `uv`
